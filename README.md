# FastAPI Boilerplate

Simple Personal FastAPI Boilerplate with postgres+postgis, auto generated migrations with alembic, sqlalchemy with async, pytest and docker

## How to use

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Edit `app>core>config.py` to your needs
4. Write your models in `app>database>repositories`; `app>database>tables` and `app>models>schemas`
5. Write the test (yep, it is important, not for you but for your boss and to feel fashion using TDD)
6. Write a new router in `app/api/routes/`
7. Explore and fix the other things (I'm boring of looking each new thing that I need to do)
